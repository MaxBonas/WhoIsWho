    <string name="tutorial_objective">Your goal is to identify the main suspect among the victim\'s entourage by discarding characters based on a witness's answers.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_advice">Witnesses may not always agree with you, and images may not always be clear. If in doubt, don\'t discard immediately, and look for another question that helps you cross them off.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_question">Can you find them before time runs out?</string>
    <string name="tutorial_board">This is your board of suspects</string>
    <string name="tutorial_navigation">If you swipe up or down on the board, you navigate through the photographs.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_selection">If you tap once on a photograph, it will move to the end of the list and be crossed out.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_enlarge">If you hold down a photo, it will enlarge, so you can better see the details</string>
    <string name="tutorial_panel">Here below is your panel</string>
    <string name="tutorial_tools">In it, you have the tools to progress</string>
    <string name="tutorial_questions">If you press here, the list of questions you can ask will unfold</string>
    <string name="tutorial_response">When you have your question ready, press here to get an answer</string>
    <string name="tutorial_guess">If you\'re sure and want to try guessing the character, press here and it will let you choose among the characters you haven\'t discarded.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_score">Here you can see your remaining time and your score. The faster you finish, the more points you get.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_conclusion">Now you know everything you need to solve the case. It\'s your turn now!</string>
